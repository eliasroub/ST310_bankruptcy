"0","# The median is less than the mean for total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, and income"
"0","# This suggests that those data are positively skewed"
"0","# The level ISLAND in ocean_proximity has only 5 observations, significantly less than other levels"
"0","# housing_median_age, median_income, and  median_house_value has maximum values at 52.00, 15.00, and 500000 respectively which suggests there may be a cap on the values during the census"
