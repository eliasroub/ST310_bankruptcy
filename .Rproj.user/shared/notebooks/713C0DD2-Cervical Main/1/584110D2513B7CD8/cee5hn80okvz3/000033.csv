"0","## to do. Look at the difference values taken by the predictors to spot binary and categorical predictors. If there are 2 values, they are binary. All predictors that measures time are considered continuous (as time is infinite and can be split). Same argument for number of partners (it can be infinite). If the number of unique values is under 10 for other predictors, we say it is categorical. Between 10 and 20, gather in bins to create categorical. Otherwise, it is considered to be continuous.  "
